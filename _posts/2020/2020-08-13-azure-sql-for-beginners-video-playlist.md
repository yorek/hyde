Azure SQL is a great database for developers as it provides *a lot* of features to build modern application. Beside the expected relational model support, it also come packed with support to

- Column-store
- Graph
- Spatial 
- JSON

and much more! To quickly learn why Azure SQL is one of the best cloud database for developers, you can take a look at this article I wrote some months ago: [10 reasons to use Azure SQL in your next project](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/10-reasons-to-use-azure-sql-in-your-next-project/)

To help all the new developers get started with Azure SQL, my colleague [Anna](https://twitter.com/analyticanna) and [Bob](https://twitter.com/bobwardms) created a truly amazing, and above all very helpful, set of videos. Here's one that shows how to create an Azure SQL database in just 5 minutes:

[Demo: Deploy Azure SQL Database - Azure SQL for beginners (Ep. 14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiBC4OxFX60)

And this is only one of the many - 61 to be precise - that have been made available recently, to help developers, new and veterans, to really learn almost everything around Azure SQL and and deployment and management options offer to you:

- Geo Distribution
- Security
- High Availability
- Monitoring

And much more. Here's the playlist:
